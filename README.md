Note: we have two project proposals, as you can see.  This is because we're interested in two different ideas between data analysis or algorithm development and wanted to get feedback.  Please grade the algorithm development proposal, though note that while sources weren't listed we do have some in mind, such as below:

Comments on both proposals appreciated!
