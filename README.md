Supervised Clustering / Predicting Next Day Rain in Australia

Eliot Seo Shekhtman (ess239), Alan Caldera (arc296)

This is an Algorithm Development project, revolving around the utility of clustering in supervised machine learning.  Specifically, we seek to find an algorithm that would allow us to find optimal clusters that satisfy constraints on their contents in a supervised learning setting.  We then seek to evaluate how this method performs in multiple settings, including imbalanced data settings when a major class is vastly overrepresented in a dataset, versus current state of the art methods.  In general, our clusters will be bounded by the class labels of the dataset such that clusters designated for one class will have the majority of their probability mass within their class.  The results of this project will hopefully extend the field of supervised clustering into a new area or improve upon current methods.

Note: we have two project proposals, as you can see.  This is because we're interested in two different ideas between data analysis or algorithm development and wanted to get feedback.  Please grade the algorithm development proposal, though note that while sources weren't listed we do have some in mind, such as below:

Comments on both proposals appreciated!
